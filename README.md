# Traffic Flows, Road Safety, and Vulnerable Road Users
To improve safety for cyclists, pedestrians, and other non‐motorized traffic. To reduce accidents / injuries.
- Analyze traffic volumes on different roads / times (cars vs cycles vs pedestrians if possible)
- Map accident hotspots using STRADA‐type data (if accessible) for Göteborg
- Compare safety outcomes over time; examine whether infrastructure changes (bike lanes, speed limits etc) correlate with fewer accidents or injuries
- Possibly predict risk of accident on certain road segments under different conditions
